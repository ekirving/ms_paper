# Polygenic selection analysis for Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
This repository contains code for the ancestry stratified polygenic selection analyses from 
[Elevated Genetic Risk for Multiple Sclerosis Originated in Steppe Pastoralist Populations](
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06618-z).

## Installation
Download the code: 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ekirving/ms_paper.git && cd ms_paper/
```

The easiest way to install all the dependencies is with the [conda package manager](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

```bash
conda env create --name ms --file environment.yaml
```

Then activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate ms
```

## Running the code

Assuming you have all the input data, you can reproduce the analyses by running:

```bash
snakemake all
```

In practice, computing the DAG of the rule chain will take a long time, and you will need a lot of computational 
resources to perform an end-to-end replication (e.g., about 1 week of wall-time on a cluster of three 96-core nodes).
